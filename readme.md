* Some browsers will complain about the extension being "unverified" and "unsafe" when installing it from the Chrome Web Store instead of their first-party web stores. Since the extension is reviewed by Google, it is safe to install. 

Alternatively, you can clone the repository, review the code and install the extension manually in developer mode ✌️
